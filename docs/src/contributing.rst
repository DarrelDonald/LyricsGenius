Please contribute! Genius has a lot of `undocumented API endpoints`_, and
the ones in that link are only some of them. You could try to implement the
ones in the link or look through Genius yourself to uncover new ones, and
implement them in LyricsGenius to make this client richer in features, and
the access it offers to Genius.com.

If you want to fix a bug, suggest improvements, or
add new features to the project, just `open an issue`_ on GitHub.
