Setup
=====
There are three ways to use the package: Without an access token, with a
client access token or with a user access token. User access tokens
provide the most functionality but they are really useful if you're
planning to use Genius's `Web Annotator`_. If you're not planning to use
it (or don't even know what it is), that leaves you with using a client
access token or no tokens. Genius's API has two interaces: the
developer's API and the tokenfree, undocumented public API. The
developer's API has limited endpoints and needs a token (client- or user
access token). On the other hand the public API is not limited and needs
no token to work. If you prefer to get information using the developer's
API you need an access token. If you want to use an access token,
read the following section; otherwise skip to `Installation`_.

Authorization
-------------
First youâ€™ll need to sign up for a -free- account
that authorizes access to `the Genius API`_. After signing up/
logging in to your account, head out to the API section on Genius
and `create a new API client`_. After creating your client, you can
generate an access token to use with the library. Genius provides
two kinds of tokens:

- **client access token**:
    Mostly LyricsGenius is used to get song lyrics and song
    info. And this is also what the client access tokens are used for. They
    don't need a user to authenticate their use (through OAuth2 or etc) and
    you can easily get yours by visiting the `API Clients`_ page and click
    on *Generate Access Token*. This will give you an access token, and
    now you're good to go.

- **user token**:
    These tokens can do what client access tokens do and
    more. Using these you can get information of the account you have
    authenticated, create web-pages and create, manage and up-vote
    annotations that are hosted on your website. These tokens are
    really useful if you use Genius's `Web Annotator`_ on your website.
    Otherwise you won't have much need for this. Read more about
    user tokens on Genius's `documentation`_. LyricsGenius has a
    :ref:`auth` class that provides some helpful methods to get
    authenticate the user and get an access token.
