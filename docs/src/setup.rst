Setup
=====

Before using this package youâ€™ll need to sign up for a (free) account
that authorizes access to `the Genius API`_. The Genius account provides
a ``client_access_token`` that is required by the package. After signing up/
logging in to your account, head out to the API section on Genius (the link
above) and `create a new API client`_. After creating your client, you can
generate an access token to use with the library.
